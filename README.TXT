STAGETWO
========

StageTwo is a minimalist child theme of the new Bootstrap4 based theme_boost from MoodleHQ.

StageTwo is intended as a starting point for development only and not for use as a main theme.
It contains a clone of the settings from Boost, but inherits all layouts, templates, classes,
etc. from Boost.
