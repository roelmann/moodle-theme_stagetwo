THEME_STAGETWO BUILDING NOTES
=============================

Currently the classes folder started out as a complete clone of the theme_boost classes
folder, with changes made (and additions to) some functions.

Theme_stagetwo should inherit most of those classes from theme_boost anyway, so one item
of work to complete will be to sort the classes folder so that it only holds the required
classes/functions for the theme, while the others should be inherited from theme_boost
and so should not be necessary in theme_stagetwo.
